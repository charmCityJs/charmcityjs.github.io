CharmCityJS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free meetup
experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not
tolerate harassment of meetup participants in any form. Sexual language
and imagery is not appropriate for any charmCityJS venue, including
talks. Meetup participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or
expelled from charmCityJS at the discretion of the meetup organizers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,
sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of
talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome
sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are
expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the meetup organizers
may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the
offender or expulsion from the meetup. If you are being harassed, notice
that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please
contact a member of meetup organizers immediately.

Meetup organizers will be happy to help participants contact venue
security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist
those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the
meetup. We value your attendance.
