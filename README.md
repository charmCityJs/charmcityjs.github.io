Oh, hey.
We're Baltimore's JavaScript community and this is our website.

## Development

To see your changes locally, you need to serve the repo as a web server.
Here's one way of doing that from the command line using [local-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/local-server):

Install `local-server`.

```
npm install local-server -g
```

Run `local-server` from the website directory:

```
lserver
```
